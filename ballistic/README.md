# Regular Kalman Filter for Ballistic Curve Tracking

Two examples for tracking ballistic curves using a regular Kalman filter.

## `ballistic2d.m`

This version estimates the position and velocity of a mass point in x and y direction, while acceleration in x and y direction is modeled as an input.

## `ballistic2db.m`

This version estimates the position, velocity and acceleration of a mass point in x and y direction while inputs to the system are unknown.
